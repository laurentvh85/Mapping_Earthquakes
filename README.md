# Mapping_Earthquakes

In this challenge I was tasked to add another style of map for the user to choose from. Additionally, I pulled in tectonic plate data from a JSON file which was subsequently plotted on the map. This data was also added as an overlay for the map. The user can choose between three different maps and choose whether to display the earthquakes and tectonic plates data.
